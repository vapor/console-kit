# ``ConsoleKitCommands``

@Metadata {
    @TitleHeading(Package)
}

`ConsoleKitCommands` provides utilities for handing commandline arguments in a Swift application. It provides ``Command`` and ``AsyncCommand`` types, as well as other supporting types, for processing commands with arguments, options, and flags.

> Note: At this time, the argument handling capabilities of `ConsoleKit` are considered obsolete; when possible, we strongly recommend using [ArgumentParser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser.git) instead.
